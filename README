add birthday

bdaycat 

a command line tool to check saved birthdays

-check = this flag is used to check a date and return names of saved birthdays
	or to check a name and return dates

-name = this flag is used to assign a name to a date before it is saved and when it is called

-add = this flag utilizes the "save a name to a date" functionality

-y = year, must be 4 digits

-m = month, can be numerical or word or abbreviation

-d = day, must be numerical in range of 1 - 31



-------------------------example command:-----------------
bdaycat -add -name "test test" -d 01 -m 01 -y 2024

bdaycat -check -name "test test"

The bdaycat command can be set to a cron job to run daily at midnight and deliver an alert to the user's mobile through the usage of a web interface. with unix,
we can query the system time and date then process that text through a pipe into the bdaycat command 


we would have to save this data to a text file to query or some kind of database when we read from with check or write to with add. a sql database would work by utilizing certain queries tied to the functions. like the add flag can call


INSERT INTO TABLE BIRTHDAYS WHERE COLUMN NAME = '%(user defined name here)%' and COLUMN DAY = '%%' and MONTH = '%%';  etc...


check could use


SELECT * FROM BIRTHDAYS WHERE NAME LIKE '%(user input here)%';
